/* Comments:-

This code defines an abstract class Position in the checkers package. The class is declared as abstract which
means it cannot be instantiated on its own, but it can be subclassed to create objects. The class does not have any
fields or methods defined at this level. It is likely that the purpose of this class is to provide a base for more
specific position classes in the game of checkers, such as CheckerPosition or KingPosition. The abstract Position class
might define some common behavior for positions in the game, such as toString() or equals(), that can be inherited by
its subclasses.
